# review-hub

a browser based, version control agnostic, code review tool

# Why?

Great quesiton, been pondering this myself. In world where github exists this amy seem a bit odd, pointless. It is, in some regards.

However, consider this use-case.

"I am a developer using SVN - i want a pull request review flow like git + github users have"

With a thin API to initialize a "review request" and "rebase it" this tool attempts to fill in a tools gap for developers using older version control system
